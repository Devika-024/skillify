Yes! This is your **Skillify** project (now **WCareers.ai**), an AI-powered career guidance platform that integrates **Generative AI** and **Machine Learning** for **personalized job recommendations, skill development, and interview preparation**.  

Your project is built using **Vite + React** (as I remember you use this stack) and has a well-structured frontend architecture.  

---

## **Project Overview**
This is the **frontend** of your project, structured in a modular way to keep components, contexts, hooks, services, and utilities well-organized.  

- **Project Root (`D:/Projects/HACKATHONS/skillify/frontend`)**  
  This contains configuration files for your project, including package management (`package.json`), bundling (`vite.config.js`), and linting (`eslint.config.js`).  

- **Public Folder (`public/`)**  
  Stores static assets like images (`vite.svg`) that are publicly accessible.  

- **Source Code (`src/`)**  
  The main React app resides here, with components, context providers, hooks, services, and utilities.
