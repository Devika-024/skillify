## **LLM-Based Roadmap Generation**
One of the core features of **Skillify** is the **Roadmap Generation** powered by **LLM models** (Large Language Models). This application helps users generate personalized career roadmaps based on a variety of input topics such as **programming languages**, **soft skills**, **industry roles**, and more.

### **Main Components:**
1. **Frontend (React + Vite)**
   - A user-friendly interface for inputting topics and receiving personalized roadmaps.
   - Visualizing generated roadmaps with easy-to-read steps and milestones.
   - Connecting to the **backend API** for seamless roadmap generation.

2. **Backend (Node.js & Express)**
   - Handles requests from the frontend.
   - Manages user sessions, preferences, and stores the generated roadmaps in the database.
   - Integrates with the **LLM server** to process and generate roadmaps based on input topics.

3. **LLM Server (Python-based)**
   - Hosts a **Large Language Model** (e.g., GPT-4, LLaMA) for generating structured, personalized roadmaps.
   - This server processes the input data and returns AI-generated step-by-step roadmaps in JSON format.
